4. career history
5. projects
6. experience in Flatiron

#### Elevator Pitch

A short summary of what you did before Flatiron, transition into tech, currently working on.

Don't:

- *Never* say "What do you want to know"
- Don't share personal stories
- Don't ramble on
- Don't emphasize your lack of experience (avoid using the word "junior")

Do:

- Focus on the value that you will bring to the team and contribute
- Talk about how you got started/interested in coding
- Your accomplishments in your past
- Limit the pitch to 30 seconds to 1 minute



Rebecca:

3 things that employers are looking for:

1. Can you do the job?
2. Will you be a good person to have on the team?
3. Can you learn really fast?

Jess:

Making it clear what you did in the past

3 points picture them as lily pads and land on each one and jump to the next one and keep practicing it and having it articulated many times.
