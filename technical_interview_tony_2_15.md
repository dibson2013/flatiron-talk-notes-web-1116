# How to be a no-brainer hire
## By Tony

### The 3 B's

1. Blog
  It's important to have a blog to show that you understand concepts and that you contribute to the knowledge body, it also gives you a chance to be discovered by google searches
2. Build
  The best way to show that you know something is by building it. There were stories of previous Flatiron grads building an app around something that they were asked in an interview and getting offered a job immediately
3. Bresent
  Presenting on a technical topic shows that you can explain something in layman's terms and that you can communicate with non-technical people

### What actually matters?

Employers are looking to see 3 things:

- Can you do the job?
- Can you work together with the rest of the team/company
- Are you smart?

### Goals in the interview process

- Advance to the next step of the process
- Learn something about the questions that are asked
- Contribute something to the companies goals maybe point out a design problem and how you would fix it

### Brain Teasers

- It's not about the answer, it's about the thinking process
- Break down the problem into smaller problems

### Whiteboard Coding

- A very common way of testing out how a programmer approaches a problem without google
- The main thing is to show that you can reason out the problem
- make diagrams to demonstrate the higher level of the solution to the problem

### Computer Science Trivia

- Big O, LinkedList vs Arrays, Binary Search Nodes, Sorts
- If you don't know something, ask about it and research it after the interview
- Even if you don't know something, try to reason it out with the interviewer

### Pair Programming

- Sometimes used during interviews to see if you can work with other people
- No distractions
- Talk and ask questions, make sure the roles are clear

### Questions that you don't know the answer for

- Don't just say "I don't know"
- Try to pick something that you do know about that topic, then say that you'll research it and get back to them

### Follow Up

- Write a blog post
