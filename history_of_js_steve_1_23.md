# A short history of Javascript
## By Steve Nunez

### Creation

JS was created in 10 days by Brendan Eich, as a result it had some issues.
For example, NaN == Nan returns false, which makes no sense. In order to solve this problem
the isNan() function was introduced. Many similar problems were fixed this way.

### Microsoft

Later, Microsoft reverse engineers js for the internet explorer browser. As a result,
javascript was inconsistent across different browsers. On top of that the CSS didn't work
across browsers either.

In 1997 ECMAScript3 was released which standardized javascript across all browsers.

It took another 10 years to come out with ES5 which included some basic things like the forEach() loop and other goodies.

### XMLHTTPRequest

The above term is a way to make requests to the sever without changing or reloading the page.

One of the best early examples of an application that utilized Ajax that made the world pay attention to the potential of staying on the page.
It was originally created by Microsoft for IE, but, within a year, all browsers had adapted it.

### Node

Google releases V8 code in 2008 and it gets adopted into Node.js, which can run on the sever side.

### Transpilers

Eventually, to alleviate the pain of writing javascript which was terrible, many different languages that were more user-friendly started coming out with transpilers that converted them into vanilla js. There is even a language (Opal) that can convert ruby code to javascript.

Other examples are coffeescript, dart, typescript, and react.

### Source Map

Eventually tools came out to point out the errors in the written source code instead of the transpiled code. Which meant that as a javascript developer, you never had to actually read or write javascript.

### ES2015

Ratified June 2015 this added a lot of improvements and useful things like string interpolation,
destructuring objects, function objects, etc.

### Today

As a result of the attention that JS is getting there are a few things happening:

- High Competition - there are many different tools for accomplishing the same task
- Rapid Tool Evolution - The tools become better much faster because they borrow from each other
- Brutal Efficiency - Tools become obsolete really quickly which sucks for developers
