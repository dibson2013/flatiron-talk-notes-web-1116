# Steve's Talk 11.29.16

### Conferences

[Ruby DCCamp](http://rubydcamp.org/) is one.

You can always contribute something.

In conferences you can learn more in 1 day than months of practice because of collaboration
You learn a lot that you don't know by being forced to talk about your ideas.
Make really good friends.

Jobs are a great way to collaborate with other people and learn faster. And feel stupid every day.

### Benefits of Pair Programming

- Find quick and easy bugs and typos
- Share things that you are interested and want to explore


### How to Pair Program

Use one computer at a time

#### Driver
##### Writing the code

- Focused on details
- Naming Variables
- Decides what to write on a low level

#### Navigator
##### Deciding what to write

- interperting tests into actual implementation
- describes what needs to be done
- decides directions to take the code on a high level


### Components of Programming

- Syntax 
- Programmatic Thinking
- Design Patterns

### Driver focuses on:
- Syntax

### Navigator focuses on:
- Programmatic thinking 
- Design Patterns broken down into logistical steps

### Agreements

- Personal Space (Ask before shoving your face down their throat)
- Which computer will you use?
- When you will take breaks? 
  - You can do Pomodoro Timers - [Timer Tab](http://www.timer-tab.com/)
- Make sure the setup is the same
  - Sublime/Atom
  - Default Flatiron Bash Profile
  - Remove things that are disturbing your flow

### Feedback

- Honesty
- Celebrate it
- Give it nicely and without being a jerk
- Receive it Graciously 
- Expect it

### Getting Help

- Be greedy but not entitled

#### Example

We're working on yield, the test passed, but I still want to know what would happen if I passed in a `lamba` and `&block`. Many times you would want to explore but if your pair wants to move on, you should respect that.

### Personal 

- Make sure that your pair is fully comfortable
- Tell your pair if you are sick

### Tagging friends in Pull Requests

- Add the @username to the pull request 

## Situations that may arise when pairing

### What if your pair is slow?

- Everybody is slow and everybody is a beginner
- Learn how to teach
- Learn a lot more through teaching, because you have to understand the concepts

### What if they think I'm too slow?

#### This is happening for one of two reasons:

- You get the concept, but you are not articulating it well
- You don't get the concept

#### What you should do about it?

- Don't be offended
- Ask to explain it to your partner


### What if they're too fast?

- Stop them and slow them down
- Don't be afraid to speak up

### What if you are not in the mood and think you can finish faster on your own?

- View the exercise as an opportunity to learn how to work together and teach.
