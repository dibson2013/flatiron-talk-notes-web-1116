# Giving Technical Talks
## By Joe

### Why?

Technical talks happen all the time especially on the job.
When you have to present a new feature to a colleague or boss. And other situations.

### Timing
- Shorter is better
- Do one small thing well
- Pick one topic
- 5 to 10 minutes max
- 1 to 2 minutes per slides

### Topics
- Specific
- Study, tutorial, example
- Learn from it, find something that will explain something that you don't understand

### Using Code
- Use as little as possible
- Only include the parts that are on topic
- Never live code

### Structure
- Introduce yourself really quickly
- Introduce Problem and go over the basics
- Show how your knowledge solves or clarifies the problem
- Summarize
- Allow time for questions

### Programs for Presenting
- Google Slides is the best for collaboration
